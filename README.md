# Hangman Terminal Game

Odin Project Reference: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming

Summary - This Hangman Terminal game was created for the purpose of learning to understand and use file seralization within programming projects. In this specific case, I've used YAML as I felt it was the appropriate choice for this project. 

    *You will be asked if you'd like to load an existing save file at the start of the game.
    
    *You will have 6 attempts to guess the hidden word before you lose the game.
    
    *You are save your game at any time by typing 'save' during the turn phase.
    
    *If you fail to guess the secret word in 6 attempts, you've killed a stick man.
